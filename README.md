   - Background: Purple gradient (#667eea to #764ba2)
   - Cards: Clean white with subtle shadows
   - Text: Dark gray (#1f2937) for readability

2. **Typography**:
   - Font: Inter for modern, clean readability
   - Hierarchy: Clear heading sizes and weights
   - Line height: Optimized for readability (1.5-1.6)

3. **Layout**:
   - CSS Grid for responsive card layout
   - Flexbox for component internal layouts
   - Mobile-first responsive design
   - Consistent spacing using rem units

### User Experience
1. **Interaction Design**:
   - Hover effects on cards with subtle animations
   - Clear visual feedback for selected items
   - Smooth transitions (0.2-0.3s ease)

2. **Accessibility**:
   - Semantic HTML structure
   - Proper ARIA labels and roles
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - High contrast ratios for text

3. **Performance**:
   - Lazy loading for images
   - Optimized bundle size with Vite
   - Efficient re-renders with React hooks
   - Fast development with hot module replacement
